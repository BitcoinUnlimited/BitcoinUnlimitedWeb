                            Some people accuse Bitcoin Unlimited of being nothing but an attack against Bitcoin. This is not true. Bitcoin Unlimited is a grassroots project by a growing number of members of the Bitcoin community which wish ensure the growth of Bitcoin transactions. It is nothing but a manifestation of dissatisfaction with the scaling path Bitcoin took last three years, that has found a growing number of supporters although being censored from the main media channels of Bitcoin since the beginning.

                            Yes. The only technical difference is that the limit is in a different file.

                        <p>
                            No. Roger Ver and Bitcoin Unlimited just share both concerns and visions: Like BU, Roger is concerned about the path of Bitcoin development and the tolerance against censorship in the community. Like BU, Roger’s vision of Bitcoin is to be digital P2P cash, not an expensive and slow settlement system for banks and networks of payment channels, that might exist some day. For this reasons Roger decided to mine with Bitcoin Unlimited in the pool he created for Bitcoin.com.

                        <p>
                            Shortly after the release of Bitcoin Unlimited 1.0.0.0 Bitcoin.com’s mining pool mined a block with a size bigger than 1MB, which was immediately orphaned. There has been no other damage than Bitcoin.com losing one block reward. But it was said that this problem was caused by a failure of Bitcoin Unlimited’s consensus mechanism.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This is untrue. The block was created too large because of a bug in the block creation algorithm. It had nothing to do with Bitcoin Unlimited’s consensus mechanism.

                    title={ "Is BU based on some new complicated AD algorithm?" }
                    body={ <div>
                        <p>
                            BU is not based on AD. AD functionality is completely optional. In case of a protocol upgrade there is a problem of what to do with economically active nodes that are left running for a long period without any supervision. There are two options:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li className='pb1'>
                                1. The network decides to cut unupgraded nodes off the network, in the hope that this is better for the majority of them. This is called a hard-fork.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                2. The network decides to make the best effort to keep unupgraded nodes on the network, in the hope that this is better for the majority of them. This is called a soft-fork.
                            </li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            However, inevitably, the are going to be protocol upgrades where both of these options result in economic loss to some of these unupgraded nodes. Thats why there should be a third option:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                3. Let node operators to decide in advance, if their node should be automatically upgraded and remain connected or not. This is precisely what the AD functionality does.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </div> }

                <Section

                    body={ <div>
                        <p>
                            In the heated public debate it sometimes appears that Bitcoin Unlimited and Bitcoin Core are two hostile camps fighting tooth and nail. The boring reality however is that the developers of both Bitcoin Unlimited as Bitcoin Core are Pro-Bitcoin and Pro-Open-Source. Despite having other opinions about the blocksize, everybody in both groups agrees that he likes bitcoin and good software (and pictures of cats). On most issues the individual members of both groups share an overwhelming consensus, enjoy to cooperate and aim to do so in the future.

                    body={ <div>
                        <p>
                            Yes, in the same sense as owners of the company have sovereign power over that company (in capitalism). Miners are owners of the physical bitcoin network and are free to run any software that they like on their machines. They are also free to configure their software however they see fit. This is how it has always been, BU does not change this in any way.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            No, because the customers of a company have the ultimate power in the end. The customers of the bitcoin network are the so called "economic majority" - everyone that uses it in any meaningful way (people sending transactions, hodlers, speculators, everyone running a full node for any economic or even altruistic reason). Again, BU does not change this in any way.

                    body={ <div>
                        <p>
                            Bitcoin Unlimited has been accused of being a tool of the Chinese government to control Bitcoin by giving the miners the power to control Bitcoin. This is untrue. Bitcoin Unlimited enjoys cooperation with Chinese miners - as with every other actor in the ecosystem -  but is in not affiliated with or paid by them. Bitcoin Unlimited accepted the application of Bitmain’s Jihan Wu as a member and is open for other miners to apply.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If the Chinese government wanted to use the miners to break Bitcoin, by the way, it would not need Bitcoin Unlimited. In fact, if it wanted, Bitcoin Unlimited would be one of the worst ways to do compared to other options.
