            "Andrew Clifford started information technology work in 1981 developing accounting applications. He consulted for 20 years on financial trading systems in the City of London: at several equities trading firms. For ten years he was technical manager for one major system which, at its peak, handled 1% of the shares traded globally. He left the City in 2010 to become a writer, then learned about Bitcoin in late-2012. Since then he has been immersed in community efforts to help this cryptocurrency develop towards translating the world economy onto a sound monetary system in order to improve living standards everywhere."
