    "statement": "I support Bitcoin Unlimited because:\n\n1. It gives control of blocksize back to the free-market and doesn't try to unnecessarily engineer economic outcomes.\n2. It supports one of the core theses of Bitcoin; namely, that the system is defined by the code its users in aggregate run.\n3. It is inherently supportive of larger blocksize, which I think is critical for bitcoin's longterm security and success. Larger blocks will allow a larger volume of on-chain fee-generating transactions, and bitcoin can only be secure and succeed as the dominant cryptocurrency if it can scale to accommodate demand for transactions both large and small.\n4. It provides another outlet for users to voice their opinion, both through running the Bitcoin Unlimited node software, and potentially through participating in or supporting the Bitcoin Unlimited mining pool. There are increasing numbers of bitcoin users who do not participate in running node software nor hashing, and the Bitcoin Unlimited project provides more options for all participants."

    "statement": "The paternalistic view of having devs spoonfeed all consensus-related choices to the user seems like it won't be viable at the much higher market caps Bitcoin is destined to reach. Gradually users will have to be given more explicit fine-grained control in order to enable Bitcoin to react nimbly to general threats, as well as specifically to scenarios where developers are compromised.\n\nThe addition of XT as an alternative to Core is an improvement over just Core, because it at least lets users choose who spoonfeeds them consensus packages; BU (at least the version with user-selectable blocksize) takes it to the next level and gives users more of a \"line-item veto\" on these dev-created consensus packages. It doesn't overly baby the user but instead encourages miners and nodes to perform their own profit-loss calculations, expanding the scope of the free market by removing the centrally planned blocksize cap that has been retained for paternalistic reasons. Consensus becomes an emergent phenomenon.\n\nI believe we have in fact always been trusting the free market from the beginning in Bitcoin, so BU just lays bare the underlying reality without entertaining the pretense that blockspace economic knowledge *or even real control* lies with the Core devs.\n\nIn short, it's time for Honey Badger to grow up and assume its true form as a creature of the market."

    "message": "Bitcoin has had a virtually unlimited blocksize limit for most of its lifetime, without issue. The block-size limit was never a limit on actual growth, but it might start to limit real growth in the beginning or middle of 2016. And in terms of perception and peak usage it might have already hurt growth tremendously. If bigger blocks is detrimental to the overal health and value of Bitcoin - which i believe it will be at some point - then miners should already be incentivised to create smaller blocks. Having better decentralisation - like we did in the past - is incomparable to the amount of security we enjoy now because of hugely invested miners which have made a long term commitment to Bitcoin."

If we need to rely on a centralized authority for Bitcoin to survive then we should consider this experiment to have failed to prove its intended theory at least in the form of Bitcoin, trust without centralized authority.
