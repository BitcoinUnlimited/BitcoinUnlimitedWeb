            "Andrew Clifford started information technology work in 1981 developing accounting applications. He consulted for 20 years on financial trading systems in the City of London: at several equities trading firms. For ten years he was technical manager for one major system which, at its peak, handled 1% of the shares traded globally. He left the City in 2010 to become a writer, then learned about Bitcoin in late-2012. Since then he has been immersed in community efforts to help this cryptocurrency develop towards translating the world economy onto a sound monetary system in order to improve living standards everywhere."

In 2014, he co-authored his first book on Bitcoin aimed at the general public, \"Bitcoin for the Befuddled,\" and also started the world's first academic journal for Bitcoin/cryptocurrency related research, called Ledger.",

His research group works closely with experimental chemists and materials scientists to synthesize and test promising materials. In 2012 he co-founded NuMat Technologies and was named by Forbes as one of the 30-Under-30 in Energy Innovation.
